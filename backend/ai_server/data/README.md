# Farmora AI Server Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the Farmora AI Server:

- `markets_database.json`: Database of all states, districts, markets, and commodities from Agmarknet
- `geocoded_markets.json`: Geographical coordinates for markets

These files are generated by the `market_database_builder.py` script and used by the `geo_utils.py` module.
